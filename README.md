This is the repository for Dog Breed Classifier using CNN Project for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Software used:-
1. Anaconda
2. GPU(for faster processing)

Libraries Used:-
1. OpenCV (Open Computer Vision)
2. Haar Feature Cascade Classifier (to  to detect human faces in images)
3. VGG16 model (pre-trained model to detect dogs in images)
4. Resnet
